# Practical Example

Let's check the score details for matchweek 25 of the 2024/25 Premier League season.

```python
from datafc.sofascore import match_data

match_df = match_data(
    tournament_id=17,
    season_id=61627,
    week_number=25
)
```

With the newly added columns, you can now directly access teams' total and period-based scores.
