# Why v1.3.0?

This new version introduces the `past_matches_data` function, making it easier to fetch past encounters between two teams.

```python
pip install --upgrade datafc
```

# New Features

You can now fetch all historical encounters of team pairs in upcoming matches based on tournament, season, and matchweek.

# Practical Example

Let's check the historical encounters of team pairs for matchweek 25 of the 2024/25 Premier League season.

```python
from datafc.sofascore import past_matches_data

past_matches_df = past_matches_data(
    tournament_id=17,
    season_id=61627,
    week_number=25
)
```
